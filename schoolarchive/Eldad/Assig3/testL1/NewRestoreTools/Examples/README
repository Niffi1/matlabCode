The mfiles example_xpy.m correspond to the examples from
the paper:

  "Iterative Methods for Image Restoration:
     A Matlab Object Oriented Approach"

   by: K.P. Lee, J.G. Nagy and L. Perrone,

you should first run the startup.m script in this
directory.  To run these examples (scripts), simply
enter the name of the file at the Matlab prompt.
