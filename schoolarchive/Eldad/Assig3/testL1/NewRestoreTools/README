             =================================

This beta version contains several new functions for direct methods,
including better SVD and Tikhonov regularization capabilities.

"RestoreTools" is an object oriented Matlab implementation of
algorithms that can be used for image restoration problems.  Some
examples illustrating how to use this package can be found in the
directory ./Examples

This current version, 1.2b1, can be used for iterative image restoration
methods.  Direct methods TSVD and Tikhonov can also be used.

The principal developers of the code are:

   Katrina Palmer Lee, James Nagy, Lisa Perrone and Ryan Wright
                Emory University
             Atlanta Georgia, USA

This software has been developed as a pedagogical and research tool, 
and is provided "as is", without any warranty of any kind.
