ERROR CONDITIONS

Please recall these are not commercial programs - error checking and error
messages are not always ideal.

Running unlicensed "educational versions" with too many data or model cells
will cause forward modelling, inveresion, and sensitivity codes to quite. Error
messages are minimal. Please check the command line window for error messages
indicating the limitations. Also, some log files contain useful error messages
but others are less informative.
